# Class Project

An application where CSUF students can post questions and answers for academic purposes based on different courses. Only CSUF students should be able to register or login to this application (based on xxxx@csu.fullerton.edu). These questions and answers should be sorted based on courses. Each registered user can then post a new question in any course he wishes to or post answer to an existing question. Each registered user can also add a new course to the already existing course list. Questions and answers once posted cannot be deleted or modified.
